# Review Confirmation Email Implementation

**Date:** Current Date  
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Ready

## Overview

Automatic email notifications are now sent to customers after they submit product reviews. The email confirms receipt of their review and provides information about the moderation process.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Added Review Confirmation Email Function

**File:** `services/emailService.js`

Added `sendReviewConfirmationEmail()` function with the following features:

- **Template ID:** `d-237146cecd3d4a49b89220fc58d2faa9` (from SendGrid)
- **Email Subject:** "Thank You for Your Review - Peak Mode"
- **Automatic Product Name Fetching:** Fetches product name from database if `productId` is provided
- **Communication Logging:** Automatically logs email to customer's communication history
- **Error Handling:** Graceful error handling with logging

### 2. Integrated Email Into Review Submission

**File:** `routes/reviews.js`

Updated `POST /api/reviews` endpoint to:
- Save review to database first
- Send confirmation email to customer
- Log email in customer communication history
- Handle email failures gracefully (doesn't fail review creation)
