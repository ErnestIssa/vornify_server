## API Updates

### POST /api/reviews

**New Optional Fields:**

```json
{
  "location": "Stockholm",
  "images": [
    "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG...",
    "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQ..."
  ]
}
```

**Full Request Example:**

```json
{
  "productId": "shorts",
  "rating": 5,
  "comment": "Amazing quality!",
  "reviewSource": "product_page",
  "verifiedPurchase": true,
  "customerName": "John Doe",
  "customerEmail": "john@example.com",
  "location": "Stockholm",
  "images": ["data:image/jpeg;base64,..."],
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

**Response Example:**

```json

  "success": true,
  "message": "Review received! Our team will verify it before publishing.",
  "data": {
    "id": "RV2024011523456ABCD",
    "status": "pending",
    "productId": "shorts",
    "rating": 5,
    "comment": "Amazing quality!",

    "updatedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

## Database Schema Updates

### Reviews Collection

**New/Updated Fields:**

```javascript
{
  // ... existing fields ...
  "location": "Stockholm", // New: Optional city/town
  "images": [ // Updated: Now accepts base64 strings
    "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG...",
    "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQ..."
  ]
}
```

## Frontend Integration

The frontend now:
- ✅ Sends location (city/town) with review
- ✅ Uploads images as base64 strings
- ✅ Expects location in review responses
- ✅ Expects images in review responses
- ✅ Displays location next to customer name
- ✅ Displays images after review approval

## Image Storage

**Current Implementation:**
- Images stored as base64 strings in database
- Works immediately without additional setup
- No CDN or storage service required

**Future Enhancement Options:**
1. Upload to cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary, etc.)
2. Convert to CDN URLs before storing
3. Store in a dedicated media collection
4. Compress images before storage

**Considerations:**
- Base64 storage increases database size
- Consider max image count per review
- Consider max image size limits
- Monitor database growth

## Review Display Format

**Frontend now displays:**
```
[Customer Name] • [City/Town] [Verified Badge] [⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐] [Date]

[Review text/feedback]

[Images if uploaded]
```

**Example:**
```
John Doe • Stockholm ✓ [⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐] Jan 15, 2024

"The product is amazing! Great quality and fast shipping."

[Image 1] [Image 2]
```

## Testing

### Test Cases

1. **Review with Location** ✅

   {
     "location": "Stockholm"
   }
   ```
   Expected: Location stored and returned in response

2. **Review with Images** ✅
   ```json
   {
     "images": ["data:image/png;base64,..."]
   }
   ```
   Expected: Images stored and returned in response

3. **Review without Location/Images** ✅

   {
     // no location or images
   }
   ```
   Expected: Review created successfully, no location/images in response

4. **Review with Both** ✅
   ```json
   {
     "location": "Stockholm",

5. **Empty Images Array** ✅

## API Compatibility

### Backward Compatibility

- ✅ Existing reviews without location/images continue to work

## Admin Panel

Reviews with location and images will:

## Best Practices

### Image Guidelines
